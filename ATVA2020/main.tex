%Regular Papers should not exceed 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references and appendices.
%
%Regular papers at CAV 2020 will follow a full double blind review process, which means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person. These are firm submission requirements, and any regular paper that does not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.
%
%Authors can include a clearly marked appendix at the end of their submissions that is exempt from the page limit restrictions. However, the reviewers are not obliged to read the contents of these appendices. These papers should contain original research and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. Papers will be evaluated on basis of a combination of correctness, technical depth, significance, novelty, clarity, and elegance.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed  an expressive string constraint language which can specify constraints on both strings and integers.  We provided an automata-theoretic decision procedure for the path feasibility problem of this language. The decision procedure is simple, generic, and amenable to implementation, giving rise to a new solver OSTRICH+.  We have evaluated OSTRICH+ on  a wide range of existing and newly created benchmarks, and have obtained very encouraging results. 
OSTRICH+ is shown to be the first solver  which is capable of tackling finite transducers and integer constraints with completeness guarantees. Meanwhile, it demonstrates competitive performance against some of the best state-of-the-art string constraint solvers.
