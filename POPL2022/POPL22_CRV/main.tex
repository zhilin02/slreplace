%Note:
%If your conditionally-accepted paper gets approved by a shepherd and
%other reviewers, you will interact with the publisher of PACMPL and
%submit a camera-ready version and a copyright form to them. Here is
%important information about the approval process, the final version of
%your paper, and its publication.
%
%[1] Revised paper and summary of changes.
%
%- Deadline for submission: 23:59 (AOE), 29 Oct 2021 (Fri).
%- Deadline for approval: 23:59 (GMT), 08 Nov 2021 (Mon).
%- Submit the paper and the summary as an HotCRP comment.
%You can attach files in the comment.
%- Meet the approval deadline. Papers not approved by then
%may fail to appear in PACMPL.
%
%[2] Camera-ready version and copyright form.
%
%- Deadline: 23:59 (GMT), 11 Nov 2021 (Thu).
%- The publisher will contact you and collect the camera-ready
%version and a copyright form.
%
%[3] Page limit of the camera-ready version.
%
%- 25 pages without including bibliography.
%- The authors can buy up to 4 extra pages. Each page costs 100 USD.
%- The appendix is not allowed. If they want, the authors will be
%able to upload the full version of their paper or its appendix
%as an auxiliary archive in the ACM Digital Library for POPL'22. For an
%example in the past POPL, see https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290329.

%This email contains instructions for discharging conditions for your
%conditionally-accepted paper:
%
%Title: Solving String Constraints With Regex-Dependent Functions
%Through Transducers With Priorities And Variables
%Site: https://popl22.hotcrp.com/paper/350
%
%[1] Lists of required and recommended changes:
%
%I hope that these lists already appeared in HotCRP as an author-visible
%comment. If not and they do not appear by the end of 10 October (AOE),
%then email me and use the following default lists:
%
%- Required changes: Implement what the authors promised in their
%response.
%- Recommended changes: Incorporate the suggestions in the reviews,
%unless
%they are wrong or inappropriate.
%
%[2] Approval for the amended version
%
%Submit the amended version of your paper and the summary of changes by
%the
%end of 29 Oct 2021 (Fri, AOE). I am sorry for the tight schedule. I
%think
%that the shepherd and reviewers of your paper need some time to check
%your changes, and this checking may require online interaction between
%them and the authors.
%
%[3] Communication with your shepherd
%
%Communicate with your shepherd or reviewers via HotCRP comments. If you
%cannot
%write or have any other issue, contact me.
%
%The identity of the shepherd of your submission is hidden by default,
%and
%gets exposed only when the shepherd wants to do so.
%
%[4] Page limit on the camera-ready version
%
%The authors can buy up to 4 extra pages, with each page costing 100 USD.
%I expect that the final version should not contain an appendix. Although
%this
%is to be confirmed, I advise the authors not to include the appendix.
%Also,
%I expect that the page limit does not include the bibliography, as in
%the case
%of submission.
%
%[5] Other administrative matter regarding publication
%
%I am in the middle of finding out the ACM publication process. When I
%get
%more information, I will contact the authors.
