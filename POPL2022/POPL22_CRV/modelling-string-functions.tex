The $\extract$, $\replace$ and $\replaceall$ functions can be accurately modeled using PSSTs.
That is, we can reduce satisfiability of our string logic to satisfiability of a logic containing only concatenation, PSST transductions, and membership of regular languages.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem-str-fun-to-psst}
    The satisfiability of $\strline$ reduces to the satisfiability of boolean combinations of formulas of the form $z=x \concat y$, $y=\cT(x)$, and $x \in \cA$, where $\cT$ is a PSST and $\cA$ is an FA.
\end{lemma}

First, observe that regular constraints (aka membership queries) $x \in e$ can be reduced to FA membership queries $x \in \cA$ using standard techniques.
Features such a greediness and capture groups do not affect whether a word matches a {\regexp}, they only affect \emph{how} a string matches it.
Thus, for  regular constraints, these features can be ignored and a standard translation from regular expressions to finite automata can be used.

The $\extract_{i,e}$ function can be defined by a PSST $\cT_{i,e}$ obtained from the PSST $\cT_e$ (see Section~\ref{sect:regextopsst}) by removing all string variables, except $x_{e'}$, where $e'$ is the subexpression of $e$ corresponding to the $i$th capturing group, and setting the output expression of the final states as $x_{e'}$.

We give a sketch of the encoding of $\replaceall$ here.
Full formal details are given in \ifproceeding the long version of the paper \cite{popl22-full}. \else Appendix~\ref{appendix:sec-extract-replace-to-psst}. \fi
The encoding of $\replace$ is almost identical to that of $\replaceall$.

A call $\replaceall_{\pat, \rep}(x)$ replaces every match of $\pat$ by a value determined by the replacement string $\rep$.
Recall, $\rep$ may contain references $\$i$, $\refbefore$, or $\refafter$.
The first step in our reduction to PSSTs is to eliminate the special references $\$0$, $\refbefore$, and $\refafter$.
In essence, this simplification uses PSST transductions to insert the contextual information needed by $\refbefore$ and $\refafter$ alongside each substring that will be replaced.
Then, the call to $\replaceall$ can be rewritten to include this information in the match, and use standard references ($\$i$) in the replacement string.
The reference $\$0$ can be eliminated by wrapping each pattern with an explicit capturing group.

We show informally how to construct the PSST for $\replaceall_{\pat, \rep}$ where all the references in $\rep$ are of the form $\$i$ with $i > 0$.
The full reduction is

Let $\rep = w_1 \$i_1 w_2 \cdots w_k \$i_k w_{k+1}$. For each $j \in [k]$, we introduce a \emph{fresh} string variable $y_{j}$. 
Let us use $\rep[(y_1, \cdots, y_k)/(\$i_1,\cdots, \$i_k)]$ to denote the sequence $w_1 y_1 w_2 \cdots w_k y_k w_{k+1}$.
%
For instance, if $\rep = a \$1 a \$2 a \$1 a$, then 
$\rep[(y_1, y_2, y_3)/(1,2, 1)] = a y_1 a y_2 a y_3 a$. 
%is $a w_1 a w_2 a w_3 a$ when $w_j$ is the value stored in $x_{e'_{i_j}}$.
%
Moreover, let $e'_{i_1},\ldots, e'_{i_k}$ be the subexpressions of $\pat$ corresponding to the $i_1$th, $\ldots$, $i_k$th capturing groups.
Note here we use mutually distinct fresh variables $y_1, \cdots, y_k$ for $\$i_1, \cdots, \$i_k$, even if $i_j$ and $i_{j'}$ may be equal for $j \neq j'$. 
%
We make this choice for the purpose of satisfying the copyless property~\cite{AC10} of PSSTs, which leads to improved complexity results in some cases (discussed in the sequel).
%If we tried to use a single variable – e.g. $\rep[x/\$i_1,x/\$i_2]$ – then the resulting transition in the encoding below would not be copyless.
If we tried to use the same variable for the different occurrences of the same reference – then the resulting transition in the encoding below would not be copyless.
Moreover, the construction below guarantees that the values of different variables for the multiple occurrences of the same reference are actually the same.

%Although, in this notation, it is possible to substitute different occurrences of a reference with different word values, our encoding will always substitute the same value.
%That is, if $i_j = i_{j'}$ then $x_j$ will contain the same value as $x_{j'}$.
%We use two variables in this case to satisfy the copyless property~\cite{AC10}, which leads to improved complexity results in some cases (discussed in the sequel).
%If we tried to use a single variable – e.g. $\rep[x/\$i_1,x/\$i_2]$ – then the resulting transition in the encoding below would not be copyless.


%By abuse of notation, we will write
%$\rep[x_{e'_{i_1}}/\$i_1,\cdots,x_{e'_{i_k}}/\$i_k]$
%to denote the replacement of the references, in order of appearance, by the contents of the variables $x_{e'_{i_j}}$.
%E.g., if
%$\rep = a \$1 a \$2 a \$1 a$
%then
%$\rep[x_{e'_{i_1}}/\$i_1, x_{e'_{i_2}}/\$i_2,x_{e'_{i_3}}/\$i_3]$
%is $a w_1 a w_2 a w_3 a$ when $w_j$ is the value stored in $x_{e'_{i_j}}$.


 Suppose $\cT_\pat = (Q_{\pat}, \Sigma, X_{\pat}, \delta_{\pat}, \tau_{\pat}, E_\pat, q_{\pat,0}, (F_{\pat,1}, F_{\pat,2}))$.
 %, $\rep = w_1 \$i_1 w_2 \cdots w_k \$i_k w_{k+1}$, and $e'_{i_1},\ldots, e'_{i_k}$ are the subexpressions of $\pat$ corresponding to the $i_1$th, $\ldots$, $i_k$th capturing groups.
Then $\cT_{\replaceall_{\pat,\rep}}$ is obtained from $\cT_\pat$ by adding the fresh string variables $y_1, \cdots, y_k$ and a fresh state $q'_0$ such that (see Fig.~\ref{fig-psst-replaceall})
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\cT_{\replaceall_{\pat,\rep}}$ goes from $q'_0$ to $q_{\pat,0}$ via an $\varepsilon$-transition of higher priority than the non-$\varepsilon$-transitions, in order to search the first match of $\pat$ starting from the current position,
        %
    \item when $\cT_{\replaceall_{\pat,\rep}}$ stays at $q'_0$, it keeps appending the current letter to the end of $x_0$, which stores the output of $\cT_{\replaceall_{\pat,\rep}}$,
        %
    \item starting from $q_{\pat, 0}$, $\cT_{\replaceall_{\pat,\rep}}$ simulates $\cT_\pat$ and stores the matches of capturing groups of $\pat$ into the string variables (in particular,
    the matches of the $i_1$th, $\ldots$, $i_k$th capturing groups into the string variables $x_{e'_{i_1}}, \cdots, x_{e'_{i_k}}$ respectively), moreover, for each $j \in [k]$, $y_j$ is updated in the same way as $x_{e'_{i_j}}$ (in particular, for each transition $(q, a, q')$ in $\cT_\pat$ such that $E_\pat(q, a, q')(x_{e'_{i_j}}) = x_{e'_{i_j}} a$,  we have $E_\pat(q, a, q')(y_j) = y_j a$),

        %
    \item when the first match of $\pat$ is found, $\cT_{\replaceall_{\pat,\rep}}$ goes from $f_{\pat,1} \in F_{\pat, 1}$ or $f_{\pat, 2} \in F_{\pat, 2}$ to $q'_0$ via an $\varepsilon$-transition, it then appends the replacement string, which is $\rep[(y_1, \cdots, y_k)/(\$i_1,\cdots, \$i_k)]$, to the end of $x_0$, resets the values of all the string variables, except $x_0$, to $\nullchar$, and keeps searching for the next match of $\pat$.
\end{itemize}

It may be observed that the PSST will be copyless.
That is, the value of a variable is not copied to two or more variables during a transition.
In all but the last case, variables are only copied to themselves, via assignments of the form $x_{e'} := x_{e'} a$, $x_{e'} := x_{e'}$, $x_{e'} := \varepsilon$, or $x_{e'} := \nullchar$.
In the final case, when a replacement is made, the assignments are
%$x_0 = x_0 w_1 x_{e'_{i_1}} w_2 \cdots w_k x_{e'_{i_k}} w_{k+1}$
$x_0 := x_0 w_1y_1 w_2 \cdots w_k y_k w_{k+1}$
and
$x^\prime := \nullchar$ for all the variables $x^\prime \in X_\pat \cup \{y_1, \cdots, y_k\}$.
Again, only one copy of the value of each variable is retained.

Copyful PSSTs are only needed when removing $\refbefore$ and $\refafter$ from the replacement strings.
To see this, consider the prefix preceding the first replacement in a string.
If $\refbefore$ appears in the replacement string, this prefix will be copied an unbounded number of times (once for each matched and replaced substring).
Conversely, references of the form $\$i$ are ``local'' to a single match.
By having a separate variable for each occurence of $\$i$ in the replacement string, we can avoid having to make copies of the values of the variables.
