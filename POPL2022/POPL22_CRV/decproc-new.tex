\subsection{Decision Procedure for $\strlinesl$} \label{sec:decision}

One of the main results of this paper is the decidability of the
$\strlinesl$ fragment of straightline formulas including
concatenation, extract, replace, and replaceAll:
%
\begin{theorem}\label{thm-main}
  Satisfiability of $\strlinesl$ formulas is decidable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We define a terminating strategy to apply the rules in
  Table~\ref{tab:calculus} to formulas in the $\strlinesl$
  fragment. The resulting proofs will either be closed, proving
  unsatisfiability, or have at least one satisfiable goal containing a
  solution:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Phase 1:} apply the Boolean rules (first row of
  Table~\ref{tab:calculus}) to eliminate Boolean operators.
\item \emph{Phase 2:} apply rule~\ruleName{Bwd-Prop} to all regex
  constraints and all function applications on all proof
  branches. Whenever contradictory regex constraints occur in a proof
  goal, use \ruleName{Close} to close the branch. In addition apply
  \ruleName{=-Prop} to systematically propagate constraints across
  equations.  This phase terminates because $\strlinesl$
  formulas are acyclic.

  If all branches are closed as a result of Phase~2, the considered
  formula is unsatisfiable; otherwise, we can conclude satisfiability,
  and Phase~3 will extract a solution.
\item \emph{Phase 3:} select an open branch of the proof. On this
  branch, determine the set~$I$ of input variables, which are the
  string variables that do not occur as left-hand side of equations or
  function applications. For every $x \in I$, use rule~\ruleName{Cut}
  to introduce an assignment~$x \in w$ that is consistent with the
  regex constraints on $x$. Then systematically apply
  \ruleName{Subsume}, \ruleName{=-Prop}, \ruleName{Fwd-Prop-Elim} to
  evaluate remaining formulas and produce a
  solution.
\end{itemize}

\end{proof}

\OMIT{
We first show that $\extract$, $\replace$, and $\replaceall$ functions can be replace with PSST transductions.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem-str-fun-to-psst}
    The path feasibility of $\strlinesl$ reduces to path feasibility of string-manipulating programs consisting of a sequence of the statements of the form $z:=x \concat y$, $y:=\cT(x)$, and $\ASSERT{x \in \cA}$, where $\cT$ is a PSST and $\cA$ is an FA.
\end{lemma}

The proof is given in Appendix~\ref{appendix:sec-extract-replace-to-psst}.
The class of programs of the above form is denoted by $\strline'_{\sf reg}$.

Next, we follow the backward reasoning approach proposed in \cite{CCH+18,CHL+19} to solve the path feasibility of $\strline'_{\sf reg}$, where the key is to show that the pre-images of regular languages  under PSSTs  are regular and can be computed effectively.


With Lemma~\ref{lem:psst_preimage}, we  solve the path feasibility of $\strline'_{\sf reg}$ by repeating the following procedure, until no more assignment statements are left. Let $S$ be the current $\strline'_{\sf reg}$ program.
\begin{itemize}
\item If the last assignment statement of $S$ is $y:=\cT(x)$, then let $\ASSERT{y \in \cA_1}$, $\cdots$, $\ASSERT{y \in \cA_n}$ be an enumeration of all the assertion statements for $y$ in $S$. Compute $\cR^{-1}_\cT(\Lang(\cA_1))$ as an FA $\cB_1$, $\cdots$, and $\cR^{-1}_\cT(\Lang(\cA_n))$ as $\cB_n$. Remove  the assignment  $y:=\cT(x)$ and add the assertion statements $\ASSERT{x \in \cB_1}$; $\cdots$; $\ASSERT{x \in \cB_n}$.
%
\item If the last assignment statement of $S$ is $z:=x \concat y$, then let $\ASSERT{z \in \cA_1}$, $\cdots$, $\ASSERT{z \in \cA_n}$ be an enumeration of all the assertion statements for $z$ in $S$. Compute $\concat^{-1}(\Lang(\cA_1))$, the pre-image of $\concat$ under $\Lang(\cA_1)$, as a collection of FA pairs $(\cB_{1,j}, \cC_{1,j})_{j \in [m_1]}$, $\cdots$, and $\concat^{-1}(\Lang(\cA_n))$ as $(\cB_{n, j}, \cC_{n,j})_{j \in [m_n]}$ (c.f. \cite{CHL+19}). Remove the assignment $z:=x \concat y$, nondeterministically choose the indices $j_1 \in [m_1], \cdots, j_n \in [m_n]$, and add the assertion statements $\ASSERT{x \in \cB_{1,j_1}}; \ASSERT{y \in \cC_{1, j_1}}$; $\cdots$; $\ASSERT{x \in \cB_{n,j_n}}; \ASSERT{y \in \cC_{n, j_n}}$.
\end{itemize}
Let $S'$ be the resulting $\strline'_{\sf reg}$ program containing no assignment statements. Then the path feasibility of $S'$ can be solved by checking the nonemptiness of the intersection of regular constraints for the input variables, which is known to be \pspace-complete \cite{Kozen77}.
}

\paragraph*{Complexity analysis.} Because the pre-image computation for each PSST incurs an exponential blow-up in the size of the input automaton $\Aut$, the aforementioned decision procedure has a non-elementary complexity in the worst-case. In fact, this is optimal and a matching lower-bound is given in \ifproceeding the long version of the paper \cite{popl22-full}. \else Appendix~\ref{sec:tower-hard}. \fi

When $\refbefore$ and $\refafter$ are not used, the PSSTs in the reduction are copyless, which means the exponential blow-up in the size of the input \FA{} $\Aut$ can be avoided.
\mat{change}
That is, the pre-image automaton $\cB$ such that $\Lang(\cB) = \cR^{-1}_{\cT}(\Lang(\Aut))$ is exponential only in the size of $\cT$ and not the size of $\Aut$.
\mat{endchange}
This means that the exponentials do not stack on top of each other during the backwards analysis and the non-elementary blow-up is not necessary.
\mat{change}
Since the PSST $\cT$ may be exponential in the size of the underlying regular expression, we may compute automata that are up to double exponential in size. The states of these automata can be stored in exponential space and the transition relation can be computed on the fly. This leads to an exponential space algorithm. More details are \ifproceeding given in the long version of this paper \cite{popl22-full}.
\else relegated to Appendix~\ref{app:expspace}.
\mat{endchange}

Moreover, since the number of PSSTs is usually small in the path constraints of string-manipulating programs, the performance of the decision procedure is actually good on the benchmarks we tested, with the average running time per query a few seconds (see Section~\ref{sect:impl}).

\color{red}
\begin{remark}
	The full logic is undecidable. We show the SL fragment is tower-of-exponentials complete. If all PSSTs are copyless (i.e. without $<- and $->) the tower-of-exponentials is avoided: the pre-image $Pre^-1_T(A)$ becomes exponential only in the PSST T and not the input automaton A, instead of both. PSSTs may be exponential in regex size, giving doubly exponential in total. Complexity analysis will be expanded in the next version.

%\begin{remark}
%  \philipp{move to related work?}
%The procedure above extends the backward-reasoning approach in \cite{CHL+19}, since standard one-way and two-way finite-state transducers were considered therein and PSSTs, in particular priorities, are beyond them\footnote{It is known that deterministic streaming string transducers are expressively equivalent to two-way deterministic finite-state transducers, which, nevertheless, is not the case for nondeterministic transducers \cite{AC10,AD11}.}.
%%, PSSTs we introduce PSST, a new transducer model that covers the $\extract_{i,e}$ and $\replaceall_{\sf pat, rep}$ functions, where priorities are used to model the greedy/non-greedy semantics of $*$/$*?$ and string variables are used to store the matches of capturing groups.

%
%At first, we can adapt the pNFA construction in \cite{BDM14}, which in turn is a variant of the standard Thompson construction \cite{Thompson68}, and show the following result.
%
%\begin{proposition}\label{prop-rwre-to-pfa}
%For each $\cgexp$ $e$, a PFA $\cA_e$ can be constructed in linear time such that
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\cA_e$ has a unique initial state without incoming transitions and a unique final state without outgoing transitions,

%\item for subexpression $e'$ of $e$, $\cA_e$ contains an isomorphic copy of $\cA_{e'}$ (i.e. the PFA constructed for $e'$), denoted by ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{proposition}
%%Let us use ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$ to denote the isomorphic copy of $\cA_{e'}$ in $\cA_e$, as mentioned in Proposition~\ref{prop-rwre-to-pfa}.

%
%%For instance, if $e = (a (ab)^*)^*$ and $e' = a(ab)^*$, then $A_{e}[e']$ is the subgraph of $A_{e}$ comprising the states $\{a_1, a_2, b_3\}$ and the transitions $\{(a_1, a, a_2), (a_2, b, b_3), (b_3, a, a_2)\}$.
%
%%Figure.\ref{fig:pglushkov} also illustrates the subgraphs corresponding to direct subexpressions of $e$.
%
%
%%\begin{definition}
%%Let $e \in \regexp[\sf CG]$ and $e'$ be a subexpression of $e$. Then a copy of $\cA_{e'}$ in $\cA_e = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, \tau, q_0, f_0)$ is a PFA $(Q', \Sigma, \delta', \tau', q'_0, f'_0)$ such that

%%\end{definition}
%
%%From the aforementioned recursive construction of $\cA_e$, we know that for each subexpression $e'$ of $e$, a PFA for $e'$, which is isomorphic to $\cA_{e'}$, is also constructed. Let us use ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$ to denote this PFA for $e'$, which, roughly speaking, is a subgraph of $\cA_e$.
%
%
%We are ready to prove Lemma~\ref{lem-extract} and Lemma~\ref{lem-replace}.
%
%\begin{proof}[Lemma~\ref{lem-extract}]
%%\paragraph*{Construction of $\cT_{\extract_{i,e}}$.}
%Let $e'$ be the subexpression corresponding to the $i$-th capturing group of $e$. In particular, if $i=0$, then $e' = e$.
%Suppose $\cA_e = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, \tau, q_0, f_0)$.
%%Moreover, let $\cA^\dag_e = (Q^\dag, \Sigma, \delta^\dag, \tau^\dag, q^\dag_0, f^\dag_0)$ be an isomorphic copy of $\cA_e$, where every state $q$ in $\cA_e$ is replaced by $q^\dag$ in $\cA^\dag_e$. Let us use ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA^\dag_e]$ to denote the isomorphic copy of ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$ in $\cA^\dag_e$.
%
%Intuitively, $\cT_{\extract_{i,e}}$ uses a string variable $x$ to store the value of the $i$th capturing group. Initially it assigns $\nullchar$ to $x$ to denote the fact that the capturing group is not matched yet. It then simulates $\cA_e$, and stores letters into $x$ when applying the transitions in ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$. Finally, it outputs the value of $x$ when $\cA_e$ accepts.
%
%Formally, $\cT_{\extract_{i,e}} = (Q \cup \{q'_0\}, \Sigma, X, \delta', \tau', E', q'_0, F')$ (see Figure~\ref{fig-psst-extract}), where
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $q'_0 \not \in Q$,
%%
%\item $X = \{x\}$,
%%
%%\item $\delta'$ is obtained from $\delta$ by adding $x: = x\sigma$ for each transition $(q, \sigma, q')$ in ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$,
%%
%\item $F'(f_0)= x$ and $F'(p)$ is undefined for all the other states $p \in Q  \cup \{q'_0\}$,
%%
%\item $\delta'$ and $\tau'$ are defined as follows,
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\tau'(q'_0) = ((q_0); ())$,
%%
%\item $\delta'$ includes all the transitions in $\delta$,
%%
%\item $\tau'$ includes all the transitions in $\tau$,
%%
%\end{itemize}
%%
%\item $E'$ is defined as follows,
%\begin{itemize}
%\item if $q_0$ does not occur in ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$, then $E'((q'_0, \varepsilon, q_0))(x) = \nullchar$, otherwise, $E'((q'_0, \varepsilon, q_0))(x) = \varepsilon$,
%%
%\item for each transition $(q, \sigma, q')$ in ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$, $E'((q, \sigma, q'))(x) = x \sigma$,
%%
%\item for each transition $(q, \sigma, q')$ such that $q$ does not occur not in ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$ and $q'$ occurs in ${\sf Sub}_{e'}[\cA_e]$, $E'((q, \sigma, q'))(x) = \varepsilon$,
%%
%\item for all the other transitions $t$ of $\cA_e$, $E'(t)(x) = x$.

%
%\begin{proof}[Lemma~\ref{lem-replace}]
%%\paragraph*{Construction of $\cT_{\replaceall_{\pat, \rep}}$.}
%Let $\$i_1, \cdots, \$i_k$ with $i_1 < \cdots < i_k$ be an enumeration of all the references in $\rep$.
%Moreover, for every $j \in [k]$, let $e'_{i_j}$ be the subexpression of $\pat$ corresponding to the $i_j$-th capturing group.
%
%Suppose $\cA_\pat = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, \tau, q_0, f_0)$. Then $\cT_{\replace_{\pat,\rep}}$ is obtained from $\cA_\pat$ by adding a fresh states $q'_0$ such that (see Figure~\ref{fig-psst-replace})
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\cT_{\replace_{\pat,\rep}}$ goes from $q'_0$ to $q_0$ via an $\varepsilon$-transition of higher priority than the non-$\varepsilon$-transitions, in order to search the first match of $\pat$ starting from the current position,
%%
%\item when $\cT_{\replace_{\pat,\rep}}$ stays at $q'_0$, it keeps appending the current letter to the end of $x_0$,
%%
%\item starting from $q_0$, $\cT_{\replace_{\pat,\rep}}$ simulates $\cA_\pat$ and stores the matches of the $\$i_1$-th, $\ldots$, $\$i_k$-th capturing groups of $\pat$ into the string variables $x_1, \cdots, x_k$ respectively,
%%
%\item when the first match of $\pat$ is found, $\cT_{\replace_{\pat,\rep}}$ goes from $f_0$ to $q'_0$ via an $\varepsilon$-transition, appends the replacement string, which is $\rep[x_1/\$_{i_1}, \cdots, x_k/\$_{i_k}]$, to the end of $x_0$, and keeps searching for the next match of $\pat$.
