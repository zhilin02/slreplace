\section{Formal Semantics of Regular Expression Matching In Javascript}\label{sec-rwre}
Our gaol in this section is to define the formal semantics of regular expression matching in Javascript. 
%
It should be pointed out that if only the set of strings defined by regular expressions are concerned, regular expressions in Javascript (with backreferences ignored) are the same as classical regular expressions in formal language textbooks (e.g. \cite{HU79}). Nevertheless, matching of regular expressions to strings in Javascript, e.g. in the string functions ``exec()'', ``match()'' and ``test()'' , are much more involved: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item in Javascript, the regular expressions are not required to be matched to the whole string, but to a substring, which intuitively corresponds to the first match of the regular expression in the string, moreover, this matching is \emph{deterministic} in the sense that for a given regular expression and a string, the matching returns a \emph{unique} substring (if there is any), 
%
\item regular expressions in Javascript typically contain capturing groups, and the matchings of these capturing groups in strings should also be returned, moreover, these matchings are also deterministic.
\end{enumerate}

In the sequel, we first define the syntax of regular expressions, which is essentially the regular expressions in Javascript, with the backreferences ignored. 
%
Then we formalize the Javascript semantics of matchings of regular expressions to strings. The aforementioned determinism of matchings of regular expressions to strings are attributed to the non-standard semantics of regular-expression operators in Javascript, e.g. the greedy/lazy semantics of Kleene star/plus operators as well as the non-commutative alternation operator.  

The key of the formal semantics is a novel automata model, called prioritized streaming string transducers (abbreviated as PSST), where transition priorities are used to capture the non-standard semantics of regular-expression operators and string variables are used to store the matchings of capturing groups. PSST is a synergy of two automata models introduced before, namely, prioritized finite-state automata \cite{BM17} and streaming string transducers \cite{AC10,AD11}. The formal semantics of Javascript regular-expression matching is defined by constructing a PSST out of regular expressions. 
%
Furthermore, we also do extensive experiments to validate the formal semantics against the actual semantics of regular-expression matching in Javascript.

In this section, we introduce the regular expressions which will be used in the string constraints. 
%The semantics of the regular language conforms to the JavaScript language. 
It should be emphasized that the strings accepted by the regular expresses introduced here are still regular, but the parsing of the string is significantly different from classic regular languages. For this purpose, we utilize prioritized finite-state automata \cite{BM17}, which extend classic finite-state automata with priorities, to capture, among others, the greedy/lazy semantics of Kleene star/plus in the regular expression.

Throughout the paper, $\Int^+$ denotes the set of positive integers, and  $\nat$ denotes the set of natural numbers. Furthermore, for $n\in \Int^+$, let $[n]:=\{1, \ldots, n\}$. 
%
We use $\Sigma$ to denote a finite set of letters, called \emph{alphabet}. A \emph{string} over $\Sigma$ is a finite sequence of letters from $\Sigma$. We use $\Sigma^*$ to denote the set of strings over $\Sigma$, $\varepsilon$ to denote the empty string, and $\Sigma^\varepsilon$ to denote $\Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\}$. A string $w'$ is called a \emph{prefix} of $w$ if $w = w'w''$ for some string $w''$. We use $\pref(w)$ to denote the set of prefixes of $w$. For a prefix $w_1$ of $w$, let $w = w_1 w_2$, then we use $w_1^{-1}w$ to denote $w_2$.

%	Regular expressions are a well-known concept in formal language. %and  have the same expressibility as finite state automata. 
%	Many programming languages provide build-in regular expressions %capabilities either built-in 
%	or otherwise via libraries. Programmers widely use regular expressions in software development, especially in the development of web applications. However, it should be emphasized that regular expressions used in programming languages are considerably different from those in formal language theory, mainly on the following aspects: greedy/non-greedy semantics of the quantifiers ($*$ and its variant $+$), non-commutativity of the alternation operator, capturing groups, and backreferences. In the sequel, we take all these aspects into account and define the class of real-world regular expressions considered in this paper.

\subsection{Syntax of regular expressions}

\begin{definition}[Regular expressions, $\regexp$]
	
%\begin{multline*}
\[
\begin{split}
e & \eqdef  \emptyset \mid \varepsilon \mid a \mid [e^?] \mid [e^{??}] \mid  (e) \mid %\$n \mid 
[e + e] \mid [e \concat e] \mid \\
 &          [e^*] \mid [e^+] \mid [e^{*?}] \mid  [e^{+?}] \mid [e^{\{m_1,m_2\}}] \mid [e^{\{m_1,m_2\}?}] 
\end{split}
\]
%\end{multline*}
%	
where $a \in \Sigma$,  $n \in \Int^+$, $m_1,m_2 \in \Nat$ with $m_1 \le m_2$. 
	%	Since $+$ is associative and commutative, we also write $(e_1 + e_2) + e_3$ as $e_1 + e_2 + e_3$ for brevity.  
\end{definition}
%We abbreviate $[e \concat [e^*]]$ as $[e^+]$ and $[e \concat [e^{*?}]]$ as $[e^{+?}]$. 
%
For $\Gamma = \{a_1, \ldots, a_k\}\subseteq \Sigma$, we write $\Gamma$ for  $[[\cdots [a_1 + a_2] + \cdots] + a_k]$ and thus $[\Gamma^\ast] \equiv [[[\cdots [a_1 + a_2] + \cdots] + a_k]^\ast]$. Similarly for $[\Gamma^{\ast?}]$, $[\Gamma^+]$, and $[\Gamma^{+?}]$. We write $|e|$ for the length of $e$, i.e., the number of symbols occurring in $e$.
%
Note that square brackets $[]$ are used for the operator precedence and the parentheses $()$ are used for \emph{capturing groups}. 
 %
%Parenthesis pairs are indexed according to the occurrence sequence of their left parentheses, and it is required that every back reference $\$ n$ occurs after the $n$-th pair of parentheses. For instance, $[[([[a+b]^*]) \concat c] \concat \$1]$ is in $\regexp$, where $\$1$ refers to the matching of the subexpression $[[a+b]^*]$. Intuitively, it denotes the set of strings of the form $u c u$, where $u$ is a string of $a$ and $b$. 
%

The operator $[e^*]$ is the \emph{greedy} Kleene star, meaning that $e$ should be matched as many times as possible. In contrast, the operator $[e^{*?}]$ is the \emph{lazy} Kleene star, meaning $e$ should be matched  as few times as possible. The Kleene plus operators $[e^+]$ and $[e^{+?}]$ are similar to $[e^*]$ and $[e^{*?}]$ but $e$ should be matched at least once. Moreover, as expected,  the counting operators $[e^{\{m_1,m_2\}}]$ require the number of times that $e$ is matched is between $m_1$ and $m_2$ and $[e^{\{m_1,m_2\}?}]$ is the lazy variant. Likewise, the optional operator has greedy and lazy variants $[e^?]$ and $[e^{??}]$, respectively.

For two $\regexp$s $e$ and $e'$, we say that $e'$ is a \emph{subexpression} of $e$,
  	if one of the following conditions holds: 1) $e'=e$, 2) $e = [e_1 \cdot e_2]$ or $[e_1 + e_2]$, and $e'$ is a subexpression of $e_1$ or $e_2$, 3) $e = [e_1^?], [e_1^{??}], [e_1^{\ast}]$, $[e_1^{+}]$, $[e_1^{\ast?}]$, $[e_1^{+?}]$, $e_1^{\{m_1, m_2\}}$, $e_1^{\{m_1, m_2\}?}$ or $( e_1)$, and $e'$ is a subexpression of $e_1$. We use $S(e)$ to denote the set of subexpressions of $e$. %
 
% 
%We use $\cgexp$ to denote the fragment of $\regexp$ excluding backreferences $\$ n$ (where {\sf reg} represents regular languages), and $\refexp$ to denote the set of regular expressions generated by a concatenation of letters and backreferences, formally %regular expressions 
%defined by $e \eqdef \varepsilon \mid a \mid \$n \mid [e \concat e]$.
