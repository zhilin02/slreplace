\philipp{problem: the calculus also uses complemented regular
  expressions; should we add those to the considered regex language?}

We now introduce our calculus for solving string constraints in
$\strline$, state its correctness, and observe that it gives rise to
decision procedures for several fragments, including for
$\strline_{\sf reg}$ formulas that are straightline and do not contain
back-references. The calculus is based on the principle of propagating
regular language constraints by computing images and post-images of
string functions. The calculus is parameterized in the set of
considered string functions; in this paper, we work with the set
$\{\concat, \extract_{i, e}, \replace_{\pat, \rep}, \replaceall_{\pat,
  \rep}\}$ consisting of concatenation, extraction, and replacement,
but it can be extended by other functions that can be represented as
PSSTs.

The calculus operates on \emph{one-sided sequents,} and can be
interpreted as a sequent calculus in the sense of
Gentzen~\cite{Gentzen35} in which all formulas are located in the
antecedent (left of the turnstile~$\vdash$). A one-sided sequent is a
finite set $\Gamma \subseteq \strline$ of string constraints. For sake
of presentation, we write sequents as lists of formulas separated by
comma, and $\seqq{\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n}$ for the union
$\Gamma \cup \{\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n\}$. We say that a
sequent~$\seqq{}$ is \emph{unsatisfiable} if $\bigwedge \Gamma$ is
unsatisfiable. Our calculus is refutational and has the purpose of
either showing that some initial sequent~$\seqq{}$ is unsatisfiable,
or that it is satisfiable by constructing a solution for it. A
solution is a
sequent~$\seq{x_1 \in w_1, x_2 \in w_2, \ldots, x_n \in w_n}$ that
defines the values of string variables using regexes that only consist
of single words.

\begin{example}
  We first illustrate the calculus by showing that the constraint
  $$x = y \concat z \wedge y \in a^+ \wedge x = \replaceall_{a,
    b}(x)$$
  is unsatisfiable.
\end{example}

More formally, proof rules are relations between a finite list of
sequents (the premises), and a single sequent (the conclusion). Proofs
are finite trees growing upward, in which each node is labeled with a
sequent, and each node is related to the node(s) directly above it
through an instance of a proof rule. A proof branch is a path from the
proof root to a leaf. A branch is closed if the last rule on the
branch does not have any premises, and open otherwise. A proof is
closed if all of its branches are closed.
