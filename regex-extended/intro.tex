stress regex, which admits features such as capturing groups, reference


symbolic execution requires SMT solving 

the main contribution is to introduce  a new transducer model, prioritized streaming string transducer (PSST) with the  motivation 
(1) using the priority to model regular expressions features such as capturing groups and (2) streaming transducers as a generic and expressive model for string manipulation. For instance, it can capture, among others, the reverse operation. 

The new 

contribution:

	\item extending Streaming String Transducers: \cite{FR17}
	
	\item  universal solution
