\section{Implementation and Experiments}
\label{sect:impl}

We have implemented our decision procedure for $\strline$ in the SMT solver OSTRICH \cite{CHL+19}, which provides a modular and easy-to-use framework for extending all sorts of string operations. As shown in \ref{sec:decision}, \PSST s satisfy the conditions required by the backwards reasoning approach of OSTRICH, which enables us to integrate our logic with standard string theory.

Our implementation supports three operators
