\label{fig-run-exmp}
\end{figure}

We use the JavaScript program in Fig.~\ref{fig-run-exmp} as a running example to illustrate our approach. The example is
contrived, but close to code found in typical JavaScript
applications.
 The function {\tt normalize}   removes leading and trailing zeros from a decimal string with the input %a string variable 
{\tt decimal}. For instance, we get results
 \verb!normalize("02.50") == "2.5"!,
 \verb!normalize("0250") == "250"!, and finally
 \verb!normalize("0.250") == "0.25"!.

%\tl{should the "and" in dblp be removed? Alice Brown, John Smith}\zhilin{I am referring to the bibtex style. Both ACM and DBLP bibtex style contain ``and''}

In the function body, the input {\tt decimal} %of the function {\tt normalize} 
is matched to a regular expression {\tt decimalReg}\,=\,{\tt /\^{}({\footnotesize\textbackslash}d+){\footnotesize\textbackslash}.?({\footnotesize\textbackslash}d*)\$/}, which requires that  the input comprises a digit sequence representing the integer part of the input, possibly followed by a dot symbol (the decimal point) as well as another digit sequence representing the fractional part. The anchors  \verb!^! and \verb!$! denote the beginning and the end of the input, respectively. Note that  {\tt decimalReg} utilizes two capturing groups, namely, {\tt ({\footnotesize\textbackslash}d+)} and {\tt ({\footnotesize\textbackslash}d*)}, to record the integer and fractional part of the decimal. The expression {\tt {\footnotesize\textbackslash}.?} specifies that the dot symbol is optional, namely, it may not occur in the input. Moreover,  the regular expression utilizes the \emph{greedy} semantics of the quantifier {\tt +} to enforce that {\tt {\footnotesize\textbackslash}d+} is matched by the whole string if the input does not contain any dots. For instance, if ${\tt decimal} = \texttt{"0250"}$, then {\tt ({\footnotesize\textbackslash}d+)} is matched by \texttt{"0250"} and  {\tt ({\footnotesize\textbackslash}d*)} is matched by the empty string. 
%\tl{i guess here we want to express that the greedy semantics is crucial; the standard nondeterministic semantics does not meet our requirement?}
%Nevertheless, 
Note that the greedy semantics is crucial here, because with standard \emph{non-deterministic} semantics the {\tt ({\footnotesize\textbackslash}d+)} could also (incorrectly) by matched by \texttt{"02"}, and {\tt ({\footnotesize\textbackslash}d*)} by \texttt{"50"}.

  The result of the matching, which is an array of strings, is stored in the variable {\tt decomp}. 
%Since there are two capturing groups in {\tt decimalReg}, the array {\tt format} is of length 3.
%
Then the leading zeros are trimmed by applying {\tt replace(/\^{}0+/, "")} to {\tt decomp[1]} and the result is stored in the variable {\tt integer}. Similarly, the trailing zeros are trimmed by {\tt replace(/{}0+\$/, "")} to {\tt decomp[2]} and the result is stored in the variable {\tt fractional}. Again, the greedy semantics of {\tt 0+} is used to trim \emph{all} the leading/trailing zeros.
%
The return value is obtained as follows: If {\tt integer} is empty, then it gets a default value \texttt{"0"}. If {\tt fractional} is empty, then the return value is {\tt integer}. Otherwise, the return value  joins {\tt integer} and {\tt fractional} with the dot symbol. 

A natural post-condition of {\tt normalize} is that the result
contains neither leading nor trailing zeros. This post-condition has
to be established by the function on \emph{every} execution path.  As
an example, consider the path shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-run-exmp-path},
in which the branches taken in the program are represented as
\texttt{assume} statements. The negated post-condition is captured by
the regular expression in the last \texttt{assume}. For this path, the
post-condition can be proved by showing that the program in
Fig.~\ref{fig-run-exmp-path} is infeasible: there does not exist an
initial value {\tt decimal} so that no assumption fails and the
program executes to the end.
\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
\begin{minted}[linenos]{javascript}
  const decimalReg = /^(\d+)\.?(\d*)$/;
  var decomp = decimal.match(decimalReg);
  var result = "";
  assume (decomp!==null);
  var integer = decomp[1].replace(/^0+/, "");
  var fractional  = decomp[2].replace(/0+$/, "");
  assume (integer !== ""); 
  result1 = integer;
  assume (fractional !== ""); 
  result2 = result1 + "." + fractional;
  assume (/^0\d+.*|.*\.\d*0$/.test(result2));

\caption{Symbolic execution of a path of the JavaScript program in Fig.~\ref{fig-run-exmp}}
\end{figure}

To enable symbolic execution of the JavaScript programs like in Fig.~\ref{fig-run-exmp}, we need to model the greedy semantics of {\tt +} and the matching of capturing groups. To this end, we propose the use \emph{prioritized streaming string transducers} (PSST, Section~\ref{sect:psst}). The extraction of {\tt decomp[1]} from {\tt decimal}, namely {\tt decimal}. {\tt match(decimalReg)[1]}, can be modeled by a PSST $\cT_{\tt extract_{decimalReg,1}}$, where the priorities are used to capture the greedy semantics of $+$ (see Definition~\ref{def-regex-semantics} in Section~\ref{sec-rwre}) and the string variables are used to record the matches of capturing groups. %Similarly for  
The extraction of {\tt decomp[2]} can be handled in a similar way. Moreover, the functions {\tt replace(/\^{}0+/, "")} and {\tt replace(/0+\$/, "")}  can also be modeled by PSSTs $\cT_{\scriptsize\tt replace(\mbox{\tt /\^{}0+/, ""})}$ and $\cT_{\scriptsize\tt replace(\mbox{\tt /0+\$/, ""})}$.

After some further simplifications, we arrive at the following program
in our string-manipulating language, capturing Fig.~\ref{fig-run-exmp-path}.  In
the program, $\Aut_{\scriptsize\mbox{\tt.+}}$, $\Aut_{\tt decimalReg}$
and
$\Aut_{\scriptsize\mbox{\tt /\^{}0\textbackslash
    d+.*|.*{\scriptsize\textbackslash}.\textbackslash d*0\$/}}$ denote
finite-state automata corresponding to the regular expressions, and
the assumptions are encoded using \textsf{assert} (using the same
terminology as \cite{CHL+19}):
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:exmp}
& & \ASSERT{\tt decimal \in \Aut_{decimalReg}};\nonumber \\
& & \sf integer  := \tt  \cT_{\tt replace(\mbox{\scriptsize \tt /\^{}0+/, ""})}(\cT_{\tt extract_{decimalReg,1}}(decimal));\nonumber \\
& & \sf fractional  := \tt  \cT_{\scriptsize\tt replace(\mbox{\tt /0+\$/, ""})}(\cT_{\tt extract_{decimalReg,2}}(decimal)); \\
&&  \ASSERT{\tt integer \in \Aut_{\scriptsize\mbox{\tt.+}}}; 
%&&  \tt result1 := integer;\nonumber\\
\ASSERT{\tt fractional \in \Aut_{\scriptsize\mbox{\tt.+}}}; \nonumber\\
 && \tt result2 := integer \concat ``." \concat fractional; \nonumber\\
 && \ASSERT{\tt result2 \in \Aut_{\scriptsize\mbox{\tt /\^{}0\textbackslash d+.*|.*{\scriptsize\textbackslash}.\textbackslash d*0\$/}}}; \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Path feasibility of the program in \eqref{eqn:exmp} can be checked by following the ``backward'' reasoning approach from \cite{CHL+19}: at first, we show that the pre-images of regular languages under PSSTs are regular (see Lemma~\ref{lem:psst_preimage}). Then we compute the pre-images of regular languages under the concatenation operation and remove the last assignment statement. Moreover, we compute the pre-images of regular languages under the PSSTs $\cT_{\tt extract_{decimalReg,2}}$ as well as $\cT_{\scriptsize\tt replace(\mbox{\tt /0+\$/, ""})}$, and remove the second assignment statement. Similarly for the first assignment statement. In the end, a program containing only regular membership queries (but possibly including disjunctions) is obtained, whose feasibility is reduced to checking the nonemptiness of the intersection of regular languages, which is known to be decidable (\pspace-complete). (See Appendix~\ref{app-br-mot-exmp} for more details.)
