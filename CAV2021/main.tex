%% some background on regular expressions
Regular expressions are a classical concept in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, which are expressions built from characters by the concatenation, union, and repetition operators. Real-world regular expressions in programming languages (e.g. C, Java, Python, and Javascript) differ dramatically from standard regular expressions in formal language theory by adopting the non-standard semantics of operators, e.g. non-commutative union and greedy repetition, as well as introducing the new features like capturing groups and back references. 
%% symbolic execution requires faithful encoding of regex semantics
String constraint solvers are one of the cornerstones of the analysis and verification of string manipulating programs. Faithful encoding of the semantics of real-world regular expressions in string constraint solvers facilitates more precise program analysis and verification.
%% state of the art string constraint solvers
On the other hand, it is rather challenging for string constraint solvers to support real-world regular expressions.
%encode the non-standard semantics of regular expression operators as well as support the new features of capturing groups and back references. 
As a result, the state-of-the-art string constraint solvers (e.g. CVC4 and Z3-str) only support standard regular expressions.  
%
%The semantics of real-world regular expressions are better to be encoded as faithfully as possible. For instance, in dynamic symbolic execution of string manipulating programs, in order to generate the inputs for execution paths and improve coverage,  the semantics of real-world regular expressions are better to be encoded as faithfully as possible in string constraint solvers. 
%% contribution
In this work, we investigate how to solve string constraints with real-world regular expressions. We propose a new automata model called prioritized streaming string transducers (PSST) so that the non-standard semantics of regular expressions operators as well as the new features of capturing groups and back references can all be supported. The main idea of PSST is to use priorities to model the non-standard semantics of regular expressions operators and use string variables to model new features of capturing groups and back references. Based on PSST, we design a decision procedure for string constraints with real-world regular expressions. 
%% implementation and experiments
We implement the decision procedure and do extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The experimental results on over 80,000 string constraints which are generated from regular expressions in open-source programs show that our implementation is able to tackle a wide range of real-world regular expressions quite efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first string constraint solver capable of dealing with real-world regular expressions.
