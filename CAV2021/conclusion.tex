\section{Conclusion}

Real-world regular expressions (RWRE) in programming languages differ drastically from classical regular expressions, for instance, they adopt the greedy/lazy semantics of Kleene star and include new features of capturing groups and back references. In this work, we proposed a novel approach for natively supporting real-world regular expressions (RWRE) in string constraint solving. We introduced prioritized streaming string transducers (PSST) to  model the string functions involving real-world regular expressions. We showed that the pre-images of regular languages under PSSTs are regular and designed a decision procedure for string constraints with RWREs. We implemented the decision procedure and carried out the extensive experiments. The experimental results showed that our approach significantly improves the CEGAR-based approach for RWREs in both precision and performance. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first string constraint solver that natively supports RWREs. There are plenty of research directions for the future work. It is interesting to extend this work to deal with more advanced features of RWREs, e.g. lookahead and lookbehind. It would also be nice to support the string functions involving the integer data type, in addition to those involving RWREs.
